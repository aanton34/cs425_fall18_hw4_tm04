Implementation of a PV Annotation System

SunnyCY is a company that specializes in the installation of Photovoltaic (PV)
Systems here in Cyprus. The company requires a way to visualize the location of
those systems on a map from a website.

be able to annotate the locations of their PVs on a map along with details regarding
the systems.
